Basic implementation of a cryptocurrency token on the Ethereum blockchain.

## Description

The program provides a simple implementation for minting and burning tokens on both the Solana and Ethereum blockchains. It's designed to familiarize learners with the basic workflow of blockchain development, preparing them for more complex projects in the future. Users can mint new tokens and burn existing ones, with exceptions preventing burning more tokens than currently owned. This ensures the integrity of the token system. Overall, it offers a concise introduction to blockchain token management, setting the stage for deeper exploration in subsequent projects.
